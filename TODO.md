# ISSUES

- [ ] Test the toggleFormat function.
- [ ] You need to double click on an applied style to unwrap it or destyle it.
- [ ] Removing styled text we'll make the cursor go back to the beginning.
- [ ] Selecting styled text then trying to destyle it won't work on first click, you need a second click for it to work.
